#### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
 A way in which an entity handles or manages its inventory from 
 one process to another process along with minimising intermediate 
 costs is called the Inventory management process.
 
 Inventory management helps companies identify which and how much 
 stock to order at what time.  It tracks inventory from purchase to 
 the sale of goods. The practice identifies and responds to trends 
 to ensure there's always enough stock to fulfill 
 customer orders and proper warning of a shortage.
 
 Inventory management involves planning, coordinating
 and controlling the acquisition, storage, handling, movement, 
 distribution, and possible sale of raw materials, component parts 
 and subassemblies, supplies and tools, replacement parts, and other 
 assets that are needed to meet customer wants and needs.
 
 These inventories may be held at the point of production or positioned 
in wholesale or retail distribution centers that serve, together with 
outbound transportation, to define the physical distribution strategy of the firm.
